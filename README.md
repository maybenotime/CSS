# CSS dataset
CSS is the first dataset for assessing sentence simplification in Chinese, as described in "A New Dataset and Empirical Study for Sentence Simplification in Chinese".  <br />
CSS consists of 766 human simplifications associated with the 383 original sentences from the PFR corpus (two simplifications per original sentence).  <br />
You can see more details in our paper, which has been accepted by ACL2023.  <br />

# Release Time
Due to time limit, we first release the CSS dataset and the additional dataset for few-shot setting.  <br />
We will release our code and other documents like task guide in July. <br />
